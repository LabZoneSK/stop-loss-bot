## About

This is simple bot to place sell order on Kraken exchange when price drops to configured target.
It creates "safety net" to prevent you loss more than you want.

The logic is following:
* Check target price for each currency
* If current price is bellow target, place sell order
* Order type is market to make sure that order will be sucessful
* Current logic will sell whole amount of currency

## Basic commands
